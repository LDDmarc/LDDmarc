Hi there!
I am an iOS Developer. Have been doing this for 5 years now, and I mostly like it 😃

Apparently, I am good enough in my field to get Global Talent Visa 💃.  So, based in the UK, but I am open to the whole world 😉

- 👩‍💻 I’m open to collaboration on any interesting project
- 📝 Find me on [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/marcushaldd)
