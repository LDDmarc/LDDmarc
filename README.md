From a fascination with numbers to the magic of coding, my journey led me to 3 years in iOS development, thriving in both large corporations and startups. I find joy in crafting seamless solutions and sharing knowledge. Currently experimenting with cutting-edge tech in pet projects, I'm on a perpetual quest for the next enchanting challenge.
